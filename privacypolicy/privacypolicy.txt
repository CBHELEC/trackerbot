We collect only the information necessary to provide and improve our Service. This may include the following types of data:

Guild ID: If Tracker is used in a server, we store the server’s ID to manage preferences and configurations specific to that server.

Technical Data
Cookies and Similar Technologies: Tracker does not use cookies directly, but third-party services or libraries may use them. Please refer to their privacy policies for more details.
How We Use Your Information
We use your information solely for the purpose of operating, improving, and customizing Tracker, which may include:
– Providing and maintaining bot functionality and features.
– Tracking usage to help us improve and develop the Service.
– Storing virtual items or currency associated with your account for in-bot activities and features.
– Monitoring for abusive or inappropriate use of the Service.
How We Share Your Information
We respect your privacy and do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal data to third parties. We may share information in limited circumstances, including:

– With Discord: To ensure that Tracker functions properly within the Discord platform and complies with Discord’s Terms of Service and policies.
– Legal Compliance: If required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities, we may disclose information as necessary to comply with legal obligations.
Data Security
We take reasonable precautions to protect your data and ensure it is not accessed, disclosed, or destroyed without authorization. However, no online data transmission or storage system is fully secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

Data Retention
We retain your data only as long as necessary to provide the Service and for legitimate business or legal purposes. If you stop using Tracker, your data may be retained for a limited time in case you return, but we may periodically review and delete inactive accounts.

Children’s Privacy
Tracker is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. If we discover that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information.

Your Rights
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding your personal information, such as the right to access, correct, or delete your data. Please contact us at trackerdiscordbot@gmail.com if you wish to exercise any rights under applicable law.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here, and the “Effective Date” will be updated. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
